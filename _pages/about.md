Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning (STIMA) at Linköping University in Sweden. My research is mainly focused on optimal test design and item calibration. I mostly use Item Response Theory, optimal design, and combinatorial optimization techniques in my research. Feel free to contact me if you have interesting topics to discuss or are interested in collaborating.

About me
======
I have a master's degree in mathematics from Uppsala University, which I later supplemented with three semesters of statistics. After working as a statistician at Statistics Sweden (SCB) and the National Agency of Education (Skolverket) for about six years, I started as a doctoral student at the Department of Statistics of Stockholm University. I defended my thesis, entitled "Test Design for Mean Ability Growth and Optimal Item Calibration for Achievement Tests" in December 2021. After working one year as a temporary lecturer, I started my current position as a post-doctoral researcher at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning (STIMA) at Linköping University.


Besides my research interest, I am interested in mathematics in general. Especially algebra and algebraic statistics. I am also interested in Science in general and astrophysics and quantum mechanics in particular. Even though my understanding of the latter is on a layman's level.
